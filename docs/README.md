The mapsforge project provides free and open software for the rendering of maps based on OpenStreetMap data. Currently, we offer a library for ad-hoc map rendering on Android devices and in Java stand-alone applications.

**We are currently in the process of releasing version 0.5.0 of the mapsforge project. While we are preparing this release there will be some inconsistencies on this site.**

- The mapsforge project uses a [compact file format](Specification-Binary-Map-File.md)( for fast ad-hoc rendering of OpenStreetMap data.
- We provide tools to [compile your own maps](Getting-Started-Map-Writer.md) and also [precompiled maps](downloads.mapsforge.org).
- It provides [simple boilerplate code](Getting-Started-Android-App.md) to build applications for Android that display OpenStreetMap-based maps.
- It provides a library to build standalone applications in Java.
- Mapsforge maps can be flexibly styled with XML style files ([render themes](Rendertheme.md)).
- Mapsforge supports Android 2.3 and above. Mapsforge has been tested on Android 5 Lollipop.
